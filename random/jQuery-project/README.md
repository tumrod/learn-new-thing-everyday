### What I learned:
* CSS and HTML from scratch to do some gradient layers
* Style font awesome
* The current version (08/10/2015), still use the rain animation from [codepen][codepen-link], in the near future, I would like to create my own rain drops from scratch. jQuery is really awesome. In the meantime, I am working on the freecodecamp and codeacademy lessons on Javascript. It will definitely increase some of my knowledge. However, I think the best way to master both jQuery and Javascript (and other languages), is to actually work on the project!
