  Playing with Bootstrap. I just want to explore different things bootstrap can do. This website will probably be the project page for my little project.
  Later on, I would love to also learn django so that I could compare the differences between Flask and django. I realized that django is more common in the industry. However, I actually enjoy using Flask so far. I would love to test both of the frameworks and see which one I like more.
