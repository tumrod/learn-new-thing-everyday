# learn-new-thing-everyday
This repo mostly will be my coding experiments for the purpose of learning certain topics/aspects of the languages. I hope what I learned here will benefit other people's learning as well. My goal is to learn something new everyday.

## [python][python-dir]
* Basic Python data structure
* I wrote some practice test materials for Software Engineering class.
* Most files are in iPython Notebook, and I gotta say that I really enjoy writing Python in iPython Notebook.
* You can do javascript, HTML, CSS in iPython Notebook as well!

## [web-dev][web-dev-dir]
* As of 08/10/2015, it consists of mostly Bootstrap templates since I eventually would like to create some webpage template.
* Flask and django would be other things added to this directory.

## [random][random-dir]
* Random things, probably will be mini-project that eventually will be on codepen.io

### [fantasy-series][fantasy-dir]
* Well, I was thinking of doing some CSS and javascript animation.

#### page-flip-with-jQuery

![page-flip](https://github.com/tumrod/learn-new-thing-everyday/blob/master/random/fantasy-series/page-flip.png)
* It's basically an original train-window before it becomes train-window. I was attempting to do a book/page fliper with javascript and jQuery.
* [page-flip's codepen][page-flip-link]

#### train-window

![train-window-multiple](https://github.com/tumrod/learn-new-thing-everyday/blob/master/random/fantasy-series/train-window-multiple.png)

* Here is my first codepen ever! It is a train-window side view. I mostly coded with jQuery and CSS. I learned a great deal in adding CSS and HTML tag using jQuery. It was incredibly fun!
* This is the [train-window][train-window-link] link to codepen so that you could see the actual animation :)

### jQuery-project
#### [rainy-weather][jQuery-dir]
![rainy-weather](https://github.com/tumrod/learn-new-thing-everyday/blob/master/random/jQuery-project/08102015.png)

##### What I learned:
* CSS and HTML from scratch to do some gradient layers
* Style font awesome
* The current version (08/10/2015), still use the rain animation from [codepen][codepen-link], in the near future, I would like to create my own rain drops from scratch. jQuery is really awesome. In the meantime, I am working on the freecodecamp and codeacademy lessons on Javascript. It will definitely increase some of my knowledge. However, I think the best way to master both jQuery and Javascript (and other languages), is to actually work on the project!
