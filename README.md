# learn-new-thing-everyday
This repo mostly will be my coding experiments for the purpose of learning certain topics/aspects of the languages. I hope what I learned here will benefit other people's learning as well. My goal is to learn something new everyday.

## [python][python-dir]
* Basic Python data structure
* I wrote some practice test materials for Software Engineering class.
* Most files are in iPython Notebook, and I gotta say that I really enjoy writing Python in iPython Notebook.

## [web-dev][web-dev-dir]
* As of 08/10/2015, it consists of mostly Bootstrap templates since I eventually would like to create some webpage template.
* Flask and django would be other things added to this directory.

## [random][random-dir]
* Random things, probably will be mini-project that eventually will be on codepen.io

### jQuery-project
#### [rainy-weather][jQuery-dir]

##### What I learned:
* CSS and HTML from scratch to do some gradient layers
* Style font awesome
* The current version (08/10/2015), still use the rain animation from [codepen][codepen-link], in the near future, I would like to create my own rain drops from scratch. jQuery is really awesome. In the meantime, I am working on the freecodecamp and codeacademy lessons on Javascript. It will definitely increase some of my knowledge. However, I think the best way to master both jQuery and Javascript (and other languages), is to actually work on the project!
